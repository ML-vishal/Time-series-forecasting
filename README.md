# Time-series-forecasting
The models that we learn in Time-Series Forecasting performed on an airline passenger traffic dataset. It has the data on the number of passengers that have travelled with the airline on a particular route for the past few years. Using this data, I forecasted the number of passengers for the next twelve months.
